## Hi, I'm Thomaz ðŸ‘‹

Having worked as a software developer for over 15 years, taught me that our craft goes beyond a hot new framework or a fancy language. At the end of the day, it's all about people and their interactions.

I'm currently working at my own [company](https://www.instagram.com/cblx.br/), helping other companies - big and small - to thrive in this digital world. It's been a game changer for me, a unique school to learn on.

My interests in the field are diverse, from simple console programs that do magic stuff to A.I. and game development. I'm skilled and highly experienced with cloud applications and information systems in general, having focused great part of my carrer in web development. Nonetheless, I've also ventured in several mobile and frontend projects.

Lately I've been revisiting my knowledge about Agile, XP practices and team management.

I'm also a fanatic reader, gamer (pc master race - love to build one myself), apprentice cook - thanks, pandemic - and a tireless learner.

Keep on coding :space_invader:!
